	<blockquote>In quick developing metropolitans it becomes harder to find an affordable and appropriate location to raise a family.
	  Housing prices continue to increase and not every neighborhood is the right environment for a kid to grow up and prepare for
	  a successful college career. This project aims to
	  answer the question, “If a family with presumably one or two children who are preparing to go to college were to move to
	  Boston, what would be the most ideal area to move to?” To rate the areas in Boston to answer the posed question, we obtained
	  and scraped data from multiple online sources that included Boston and Cambridge housing rates, crime rates, population by age,
	  corresponding neighborhoods to zip codes and education information.

	<blockquote>  All of the datasets are organized by zip code, which allowed the creation of 3 datasets that found correlations
	  between 2-bedroom apartment rates, crime rates, college graduation an population by age. To transform the data tiers were
	  created of housing prices and mapped averages of crime data, graduation rates and populations of ages 15-19 for those
	  respective areas. Initially, the housing prices were broken up into tiers for “average Rent 2 bedroom”, based on zipcodes.
	  The crime score for Boston and Cambridge were normalized and assigned by tier. A similar approach was used for the graduation
	  rate data. A MapReduce algorithm was used to average graduation rates per tier, to create education rates per tier. Finally,
	  to indicate what the average age of the population of 15-19 year olds was another MapReduce was used and AgeByTier was created. 
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	  For the second part of the project statistical analysis was performed to check correlation between housing prices and crime
	  rates, college graduation rates, and the age of the population.

	<blockquote>
	  Lastly, Prices of houses in a given area were predicted; using linear regression values for graduation rates, age by population
	  and crime rates. The results were compared with the value of the houses against the actual prices of the houses to determine
	  whether or not the price reflected the value of the house. This data can be used to advise families that are looking into
	  buying a house in Boston. The results tell whether or not the house they are looking at is a good buy for the asking price.

	<blockquote>
	  A limitation of the data, which simplified our job, but additionally is a restriction to the precise location of the house,
	  is that all the data is organized by zip code. Within a single zip code, one can find very different looking 2 bedroom
	  apartments, generalizing by zip code is thus a limitation. Furthermore, crime rate is similarly very generalized data.
	  A family moving to Boston might be interested in violence on the streets, robbery, etc., crime that influences their
	  child safety, rather than for example crime like fraud.
